AI thought process: Using policy based strategy, base top 5 moves are C4 (96.70%), C5 (2.73%), F4 (0.21%), G6 (0.09%), E4 (0.03%). Strategy override, using policy-weighted strategy instead. Top policy move has weight > 90.0%, so overriding other strategies.];B[ee]SQ[dc][ee][cd][ce]MA[cc]C[Move 9: B E5
