AI thought process: Using policy based strategy, base top 5 moves are O16 (95.15%), R17 (0.53%), Q4 (0.53%), O18 (0.22%), C12 (0.18%). Strategy override, using policy-weighted strategy instead. Top policy move has weight > 90.0%, so overriding other strategies.];B[pf]SQ[cq][qf][pg][lc][qg]MA[pf]C[Move 11: B Q14
