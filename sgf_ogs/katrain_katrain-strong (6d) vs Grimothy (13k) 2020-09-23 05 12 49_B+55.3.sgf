AI thought process: Using policy based strategy, base top 5 moves are E4 (94.15%), G4 (3.37%), F5 (1.55%), E3 (0.68%), G6 (0.03%). Strategy override, using policy-weighted strategy instead. Top policy move has weight > 90.0%, so overriding other strategies.];W[fe]SQ[cd][gd][gc][cf]MA[gg]C[Move 6: W F5
