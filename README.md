# Bots
This repository contains 

* The source code used to run the katrain-* bots on OGS
* Some code to test them and run selfplay tournaments.
* Most SGFs for games played by the bots.
* A bunch of data analysis scripts for rank estimation and calibration.
 
It is here for those who want to look at it, but is without support and liable to break without warning.
